There are two files that files that calculate solutions
to the traveling salesman problem. 

final.py calculates solutions for the following input files:
test-input-1.txt
test-input-2.txt
test-input-3.txt
test-input-4.txt
test-input-5.txt
test-input-6.txt
test-input-7.txt
tsp_example_1.txt
tsp_example_2.txt

final.py runs a simulated annealing algorithm. This
will return different results to the output file each
time it is run, because of a randomization element in 
it.

To run final.py in flip the command should be:
$python final.py <inputFileName>

greedyFinal.py calculates solutions for the input file:
tsp_example_3.txt

To run greedyFinal.py in flip the command should be:
$python greedyFinal.py tsp_example_3.txt

The best solutions for the input files are in the zip
folder with the .tour extension.
